Where I am at
-------------

I am in qs_Quantity.cpp implementing QuantitiesSequence coder. It compiles, but I haven't tested it yet.
It uses IntCoders and IntPredictors (and not a DoublesCoder) because that seemed easier to me tonight :-)

To do:

1. test coding works and have a look at the output
2. write a decoder and test properly
3. Add a quantity sequence (compressed) header.

Note there is a weird compile problem with having to cast away constness on a bitSink:

BitSink& bitSink = (BitSink&)bitSinks[n];
intCoders[n]->flush(bitSink);

that could be a stupid bug on my behalf.
